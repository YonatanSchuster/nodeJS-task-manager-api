# task manager API 🧑‍💻

Using Postman and mongoDB Compass I created an task manager api.

Using postman, I can send GET or POST requests and create new tasks or useres and also delete/update them. 
- When someone create a new user he will be greeted by an email! also when he will delete his account...
- When someone creates a new user he or she can upload a profile picture
